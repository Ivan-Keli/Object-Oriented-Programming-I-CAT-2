- Student.java:
  
Demonstrates encapsulation with private attributes and public getters/setters
The validation works correctly - when you set an invalid grade (150), it gets reset to 0

- MethodDemo.java:
  
Shows method overloading with the MathOperations class having two multiply methods
Demonstrates method overriding with Animal, Dog, and Cat classes
Polymorphism is working as expected with each animal making its appropriate sound

- DivisionWithExceptionHandling.java:
  
Successfully takes user input for division
Note that when you divided 7 by 9, you got 0 because in Java, integer division drops the decimal part
The exception handling would work if you tried to divide by zero

- AbstractionDemo.java:
  
Shows abstraction with the abstract Appliance class and its concrete implementations
Both Fan and TV provide their own implementations of the turnOn() method
